# RISC-V Processor SMBIOS Tables
## RISC-V SMBIOS Type 4 Processor Information
The information in SMBIOS Type 4 defines the attributes of a single RISC-V
processor. Below fields in SMBIOS Type 4 contain RISC-V processor-specific
information which is introduced in SMBIOS v3.3.0. All other fields SMBIOS
Type 4 are built depends on RISC-V capability accordingly.                                                     

### Offset 06h Processor Family
RISC-V processor is cataloged into three families. Due to the width of
this filed is in 8-bit length which can't fit RISC-V processor family
value, RISC-V processor family is declared in *offset 28h* 
***Processor Family 2*** with *offset 06h* ***Processor Family*** set to
FEh according to SMBIOS spec.

### Offset 08h Processor ID
For RISC-V class CPUs, the processor ID contains a QWORD Machine
**Vendor ID CSR (mvendroid)** of RISC-V processor hart 0. More
information of RISC-V class CPU feature is described in RISC-V
processor additional information (SMBIOS Type 44)

### Offset 26h Processor Characteristics
***Processor Characteristics*** is set according to RISC-V processor
capability accordingly.
- Both Bit 2 and Bit 8 must be 0 if RISC-V processor only support RV32.
- Bit 2 set to 1 if RISC-V processor supports RV64.
- Bit 8 set to 1 if RISC-V processor supports RV128.

## RISC-V SMBIOS Type 44 Processor Additional Information
The information in this structure defines the processor additional
information in case SMBIOS type 4 is not sufficient to describe
processor characteristics. The SMBIOS type 44 record has a reference
handle field to link back to the related SMBIOS type 4 record. There
may be one or multiple SMBIOS type 44 records linked to the same SMBIOS
type 4. For example, where the SMBIOS type 44 records describe each core
specific information in a processor. SMBIOS type 44 defines the standard
header for the processor-specific block (see section 7.45.1), while the
content of processor-specific data is maintained by processor architecture
workgroups or vendors in a separate document (see 7.45.2).

### Standard Processor Additional Information (Type 44) structure
Below is the standard header of SMBIOS type 44 defined in SMBIOS spec
v3.3.0, the total length of entire SMBIOS type 44 is indicated in
*offset 01h* and the value must be less than or equal to 255 in bytes
according to section 6.1.2 in https://www.dmtf.org/standards/smbios[SMBIOS spec 3.2.0 spec].

Processor-specific Block specified at offset 06h.

structure.
|04h|Referenced Handle|WORD|Varies| Handle, or instance number, associated

defined in SMBIOS section 7.45.1.

### RISC-V Processor-specific Block Structure
RISC-V processor-specific additional information is constructed by RISC-V boot
loader such as uboot, coreboot, UEFI edk2 firmware, etc. SMBIOS Type 44 is
referred by RISC-V software for recognizing RISC-V hart capability. RISC-V
SMBIOS Type 44 Processor-specific Block is version controlled which use major
and minor versioning in 16-bit value at *offset 0*. The new fields must be added
to the end of this table for the backward compatible.
